        <h1>What is Dogecoin?</h1>
        <p> The official <a href=dogecoin.com>Dogecoin website</a> describes dogecoin as "an open source peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide." Unfortunately, I was not able to get any Shiba Inus to comment on this.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin">Wikipedia</a> describes it as a cryptocurrency with a "satirical nature" that some consider to be a "legitimate investment prospect". Dogecoin is an open-source cryptocurrency which has acquired a large following in recent times. It is secure and decentralised. It bears many similarities to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, although the main difference is that it is notably cheaper, and thus has a lower cost of entry.
          Most people find themselves buying Dogecoin to support the satire, but some have seriously invested in it, and allegedly made large profits. I will not bother referencing this as it is not reliable information, since it mainly comes from anonymous strangers posting on the Internet. It is not reliable; however, since Dogecoin has skyrocketed in value, as detailed later, some early adopters will definitely have made a very large profit.

          This has been very well documented recently, however, records get scarcer the closer one gets to the launch of the technology. Despite some issues in obtaining information, a very clear trend is present.<br>
