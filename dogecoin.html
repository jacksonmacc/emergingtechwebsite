        <h1>What is Dogecoin?</h1>
        <p> The official <a href=dogecoin.com>Dogecoin website</a> describes dogecoin as "an open source peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide." Unfortunately, I was not able to get any Shiba Inus to comment on this.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin">Wikipedia</a> describes it as a cryptocurrency with a "satirical nature" that some consider to be a "legitimate investment prospect". Dogecoin is an open-source cryptocurrency which has acquired a large following in recent times. It is secure and decentralised. It bears many similarities to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, although the main difference is that it is notably cheaper, and thus has a lower cost of entry.
          Most people find themselves buying Dogecoin to support the satire, but some have seriously invested in it, and allegedly made large profits. I will not bother referencing this as it is not reliable information, since it mainly comes from anonymous strangers posting on the Internet. It is not reliable; however, since Dogecoin has skyrocketed in value, as detailed later, some early adopters will definitely have made a very large profit.

        <h1>Dogecoin Pricing</h1>
        <p>
          This has been very well documented recently, however, records get scarcer the closer one gets to the launch of the technology. Despite some issues in obtaining information, a very clear trend is present.<br>
          <p class="graphContainer"><iframe class="graph" width="454" height="281" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQiVyQKZCrcIfg-o1ifCihoadL78gm7jEqOgXWUy6DWIVf-lMKGdezMwqZx3a0Njl0ym7CaxOSlvJKr/pubchart?oid=195473866&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p><br>

          As one can see, the price of Dogecoin has grown from next to nothing to $0.47453 on the 20/5/2021 at the very end of the graph. The gradient of the graph becomes steeper and steeper, until it is almost vertical at the end of the graph.
          Barely, visible, there is a sharp dip in the price towards the end. This is due to Elon Musk referring to Dogecoin as a "hustle" in a Saturday Night Live interview<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-10/what-is-dogecoin-elon-musk-saturday-night-live/100128024"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
          The main takeaway from this should be that Dogecoin increased in price dramatically through May 2021, which means that there was more demand for the currency. Elon Musk had hyped it up with various tweets that month, and many were buying into it.
          <br>A closer look at the year leading up to the event is detailed here:<br>
