        <h1>Survey</h1>
        <p>As stated before, I used a survey to collect a lot of data regarding people's opinions on dictation as well as some comparisons between typing and dictation. <br>
          The first of the above graphs shows people's opinions regarding dictation. I used a Likert Scale to gauge these opinions, asking them on a 5 part scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
          As can be seen, there is a similar trend/skew for its usefulness and speed, most agreeing that it was useful and/or fast. This is further supported by the following quote from an article stemming from a study made regarding dictation:</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">“An average page of text takes about 2 minutes to speak, but 14 minutes to type, which means speaking is has an 86-percent time savings.”</p>
          <p>However, there was a much more surprising range when asked about how many errors dictation made when the respondents had used it. This will be explored further later. <br>
            The second graph I gathered from my survey which is the last graph depicted above was based on the typing and dictation I asked survey respondents to do in my survey. It gathers the averages and compares them on the graph.
            As can be seen, dictating a paragraph took far less time than typing out that very same paragraph, as can be seen by the steep gradient.
            The error count, however, whilst being higher for dictation, had a shallower gradient, and this is to be expected as the paragraph had some mathematical lexemes that not all dictation softwares would understand and thus errors are to be expected.</p>
        <h1>Experimentation</h1>
        <p>The second/middle graph above stemmed from the data I recorded by experimenting different dictation software I had access to with the same paragraph used by those doing the survey. As you can see, some of the software comes free with the device, whereas others must be bought individually.
          As was referenced above when talking about the errors part of the first survey graph, different dictation software make more errors than others and some with specific purposes, such as the Dragon Medical Practice Edition, don't do as well when used outside their specific purpose. 
          Overall, Word 365&trade;, although slightly slower than iOS' dictation, made the least errors and almost had the fastest time (time varied depending on how slow I needed to speak for it to keep up with me), making it one of the best. However, unlike the pre-installed iOS or Samsung dictation, Microsoft 365&trade; and by extension Word 365&trade; must be purchased separately.

      <h1>Usefulness for Impaired People</h1>
      <p>
        Another thing I looked for when researching dictation is its aid with those who have some mental or physical condition such as dyslexia and ADHD that makes it more difficult for them to read, write or type and how much dictation helps them. One university student, Caida Mendelsohn, wrote an article about her experiences as a result of dyslexia. She said that as a result of her dyslexia and ADHD, it “takes [her] more mental energy and work to write than it does for most people”. However, one helper in the university suggested she use dictation to hell with her essays and other written assessments. She said “Dictation helped ease the strain of trying to remember sentences before writing them down”, although it wasn't a be all end all solution, as dictation did make some mistakes she had to fix up. However, overall it helped her a lot.
        I also was able to interview a teacher who has dyslexia and she had a similar opinion as well as liked the speed and utility of being able to type without having her hands on her phone or laptop.

      <h1>Interview Opinions</h1>
      <p>
        As can be seen in the first graph above, I asked those I interviewed a few questions regarding if they've heard of dictation, used it, they're opinion on it and whether they think it will become more useful in the future. As you can see, many had heard of dictation and believed that it would useful in future, majority of them having used it before. However, many didn't believe it was too good from what they had seen, which is interesting in comparison to what has been shown above.</p>
        <h1>Interview Timings</h1>
        <p>In my interviews, I also asked the interviewees to type and dictate the same small quote without correcting their errors to see which was faster. As can be seen above, typing on average was much slower than dictation.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <h1>Overall</h1>
      <p>
        Returning to the original question, "How much more efficient is dictation than regular typing?", we look at the three factors that make up efficiency, time, cost and effort. <br>
        In terms of time, the research above certainly shows that dictation is faster. For cost, much of the software used came free with the device it was being used on, making this section a draw between typing and dictation. Lastly, while typing takes more effort to start with than dictation, those using dictation sometimes have to return and fix up things that the dictation misheard, ultimately resulting in the effort depending on how strong one is at typing. <br>
        Overall, I would judge dictation as slightly more efficient than typing with these criteria, but as stated before, this depends on how good a user's typing skills are.
