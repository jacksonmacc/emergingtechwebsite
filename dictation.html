                  the spoken word into the written word.
                  Sometimes it is called digital dictation or audio typing, but these terms generally refer to ‘office

          <p>In this investigation, I took to three main sources of information: experimentation I conducted myself; a

        <h1>Survey</h1>
        <p>As stated before, I used a survey to collect a lot of data regarding people's opinions on dictation as well as some comparisons between typing and dictation. <br>
          The first of the above graphs shows people's opinions regarding dictation. I used a Likert Scale to gauge these opinions, asking them on a 5 part scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
          As can be seen, there is a similar trend/skew for its usefulness and speed, most agreeing that it was useful and/or fast. This is further supported by the following quote from an article stemming from a study made regarding dictation:</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic;">“An average page of text takes about 2 minutes to speak, but 14 minutes to type, which means speaking is has an 86-percent time savings.” <a href="https://blog.speech.com/2017/06/01/why-are-you-still-typing-dictation-is-seven-times-faster/#:~:text=It's%20not%20only%20easier%20to,seven%20times%20faster%20than%20typing"><sup style="font-style: normal;">[7]</sup></a></p>
          <p>However, there was a much more surprising range when asked about how many errors dictation made when the respondents had used it. This will be explored further later. <br>
            The second graph I gathered from my survey which is the last graph depicted above was based on the typing and dictation I asked survey respondents to do in my survey. It gathers the averages and compares them on the graph.
            As can be seen, dictating a paragraph took far less time than typing out that very same paragraph, as can be seen by the steep gradient.
            The error count, however, whilst being higher for dictation, had a shallower gradient, and this is to be expected as the paragraph had some mathematical lexemes that not all dictation softwares would understand and thus errors are to be expected.</p>
