      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p> We are a group of 3 Yr 11 students from Ballarat, Australia who are studying Information Technology. We were
        tasked with creating an infographic based on an emerging technology of our choice. This could include things
        such as smartphones, wearable tech, etc.

      <h1>Dogecoin</h1>
      <p>
        Dogecoin has been in the news frequently over the past few years, and it had quickly gained popularity and, more
        importantly, value. In fact, on the 20/5/2021, Dogecoin hit a price of $0.47453 (<a
          href="references.html#dogecoin">Yahoo Finance</a>), from its original price of almost $0 when it
        launched in late 2013 (<a href="references.html#dogecoin">Wikipedia</a>).
        It's backed by thousands, from the average person to Elon Musk himself. You will frequently see people praise it
        and advocate buying into it.
        But here lies the biggest challenge in the adoption of Dogecoin as a legitimate currency: trying to tell if
        people are being sarcastic or not. (just kidding)<br>
        In this section I will try to use as little sarcasm as
        possible and deliver you the answer to this question: How viable is Dogecoin in today's world?
        I will review it as a currency, a technology and, of course, as a cultural phenomenon/meme, whichever you
        prefer.

      <h1>3D Printing</h1>
      <p> 3D printing is the physical production of a digital part or object through the use of hardware and software
        Technologies. These final objects can be used in a variaty of applications such as
        prototyping, small scale manufacturing and for hobbist. 3D printing has grow in recent times due to increased
        coverage in the media and 3D Printers
        becoming significantly more affordable than 5 years ago.

      <h1>Dictation</h1>
      <p> "Audio transcription itself, digital or other, is the art of turning the spoken word into the written word.
        Sometimes it is called digital dictation or audio typing, but these terms generally refer to ‘office
        correspondence’." <br>
        In this area, we will discuss the efficiency of audio transcription, or otherwise known as dictation. We will
        look at the three major aspects when judging something as efficient: <br>
        -Its time usage <br>
        -Its costly-ness <br>
        -The effort needed by the user for it to work
